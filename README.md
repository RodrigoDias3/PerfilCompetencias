# **Skills Profile**

For privacy reasons and because the project is still under development, I won't be able to post the application code, but I will try to demonstrate the work done so far and the next steps in the project.

## üìå **About the project**

Skills Profile is an application developed in Kotlin using Spring Boot, with a MySQL database. The system is intended for Universidade Lus√≥fona and its main objective is to facilitate the collection and analysis of student and employee competencies, using forms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## üéØ **Motivation**

The need for the project arose from a real problem identified by the University's Human Resources (HR) Department. Currently, the collection and analysis of competencies are time-consuming processes and depend on manual interpretations, making it difficult to gain insights into the progress of students and employees. This application proposes to automate this process, providing a practical and efficient tool for data analysis.

## **üîß Features**
The application has three modes of use:

- **Student** mode:
  - Filling in forms with multiple choice questions.
  - Viewing progress.

- **Teacher** mode (middle management):
  - Filling in forms with open answers.
  - Use of NLP to analyze responses.

- **Human Resources** (HR) mode:
  - Visualization of average results for students and employees.
  - Data export for future analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

The application follows an architecture based on `Spring Boot`, being responsible for processing `HTTP` requests and generating dynamic HTML pages through `Thymeleaf`. The structure includes:

- **Backend**: Developed in `Kotlin` with `Spring Boot`.
- **Database**: `MySQL` for data storage and management.
- **Frontend**: `HTML`, `Bootstrap` and `Chart.js` for data visualization.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: `OLLAMA` for skills analysis.

## üèÜ **Conclusion**
The Skills Profile presents itself as an innovative solution for Lus√≥fona University, optimizing the collection and analysis of skills. The use of NLP and interactive visualizations makes the process more efficient and accessible to students, employees and the HR team.
